# Tablet Configuration

###Software

In order to make a tablet read for use with Planet Learning we must install four pieces of software, Firefox web browser, Adobe Flash Player, Office Suite, and the OLE Take Home application. 

There are two options for installing the software:

1. Direct download of the software to the tablet. This assumes a relatively fast internet connection. 
2. Download the software to a USB storage drive and install from the USB drive to the tablet. 

The easiest way to install the needed software to the tablets is via a USB drive. You can download the needed files directly from OLE via the links below.

*  [Firefox Web Browser](http://https://drive.google.com/a/ole.org/file/d/0BwJDzlwGL8kKcmJVOS14WkQ5d28 "Firefox Web Browser")
*  [Adobe Flash](https://drive.google.com/a/ole.org/file/d/0BwJDzlwGL8kKc29Xd0JueFN0TzQ "Adobe Flash")
*  [Office Suite](https://drive.google.com/a/ole.org/file/d/0BwJDzlwGL8kKa2UtTElTSFFTSWc "Office Suite")
*  [OLE Take Home App](https://drive.google.com/a/ole.org/file/d/0BwJDzlwGL8kKZzc4RDlfUTNpanc "OLE Take Hope App")

Once all files are downloaded to the USB drive you can eject the drive from the computer and plug it in to the tablet. You will need a USB A to USB C converter. It will look something like this:
